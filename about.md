Hi, I'm Graham. I'm a design-centric software developer, currently focused on Android development. I recently graduated from Carleton College with a major in Computer Science and Math/Stats.

In 2017, I went to India on a Fulbright grant to work on an Android app for an education social organization in India. The app distributes creative lesson plans to teachers. It's available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jnanaprabodhini.happyteacherapp) and has been installed on over 16,000 devices. The new version is launching soon; the source code is available [here](https://github.com/HappyTeacher/HappyTeacherAndroid).

I also play music. Listen to my most recent album [here](https://grahamearley.bandcamp.com).
