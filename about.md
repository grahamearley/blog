Hi, I'm Graham. I'm a design-centric software developer, currently focused on Android development. I recently graduated from Carleton College with a major in Computer Science and Math/Stats.

My main project right now is an Android app I'm developing for an education social organization in India. The app distributes creative lesson plans to teachers across India. It's available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jnanaprabodhini.happyteacherapp) and has been installed on over 13,000 devices. I just returned from India, where I was on a Fulbright grant to improve the app and to study its impact.

I also play music. Listen to my most recent album [here](https://grahamearley.bandcamp.com).
