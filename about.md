Hi, I'm Graham. I'm a design-centric software developer, currently focused on Android development. I recently graduated from Carleton College as a Computer Science and Math/Stats major.

My main project right now is an Android app I'm developing for an education nonprofit in India. The app distributes creative lesson plans to teachers across India, particularly those who don't have the time or resources to come up with lesson plans of their own. It's available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jnanaprabodhini.happyteacherapp) and has been installed on over 13,000 devices. I'm currently in India on a Fulbright grant to improve the app and to study its impact. Read more [here](http://fulbright.grahamearley.website).

I also play music. Listen to my most recent album [here](https://grahamearley.bandcamp.com).
