Hi, I'm Graham. I'm a design-centric software developer, currently focused on Android development. I just finished an internship on the Android team at [Vurb](https://vurb.com/).

My main project right now is an Android app I'm developing for an education NGO in India. The app distributes creative lesson plans to teachers across India, particularly those who don't have the time or resources to come up with lesson plans of their own. It's available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jnanaprabodhini.happyteacherapp) and has been installed on over 10,000 devices.

I also play music, which you can listen to on my [Soundcloud page](soundcloud.com/grahamearley).
